experimental repo for moving some blobby hacky statemachines from old code over
to freertos.

goals are:
a) easier to read and extend code
b) lower power

(lower power by not having to fiddle with _everythign_ myself, and just letting
a lot of it go with freertos's existing low power code)

code is targetting a private experimental node, based on the karlnet boxcar v4b
board.
